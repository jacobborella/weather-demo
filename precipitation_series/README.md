# Precipitation data

Edit create_grid.py and create_weather_data to have the same stepsize. The stepsize decides the number of points to generate for the grid. You can also modify NUMBER_OF_DATES to decide how long a time series to ingest.

To ingest data run ingest_data.sh.
query.txt contains a pipteline you can then run against the database.
