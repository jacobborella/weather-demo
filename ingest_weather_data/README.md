# Ingest Weather Data

This directory contains the scripting needed to read an actual grib file and ingest the data into MDB.

You need to install gdal as well as other needed libraries. _install.sh_ provides an example installation file for Ubuntu. Change the file to the OS of your choice.

Run _./ingest_data.sh_ to ingest the actual data into MDB.
